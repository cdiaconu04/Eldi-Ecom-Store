When folded, the wallet measures 3 1/2\" x 4 1/2\" (9.5 cm x 12 cm) and can fit in the back pocket of your jeans or in a pocket of your jacket. Once opened, it offers six horizontal card pockets, two larger hidden pockets that can fit more cards or ID, and a compartment for bills.

            description: "Made from Tobacco Pueblo vegetable tanned leather supplied by the Badalassi Carlo tannery from Italy, this strap exhibits saddle stitching in your choice of 10 colors with a durable waxed round polyester thread. The Badalassi Carlo Tannery in Italy is well known for their premium vegetable tanned leathers and the beautiful colors that they are able to produce. The Pueblo is their top grade full grain leather and has a supple feel and a unique rustic look that develops an amazing patina as it ages. We crafted this beautiful leather into a 2 mm thick strap which sits comfortably on the wrist of the wearer and complements any watch. The edges are beveled and burnished by hand to a smooth finish that adds character and durability; the leather strap is fitted with spring bars and a high quality stainless steel buckle. This watch strap is offered in S, M, and L lengths, for 18mm, 20 mm, 22 mm, and 24 mm lug widths, in tapered design. In a tapered design, the width changes from the watch lugs to the buckle or from watch lugs to the area of the long strap with pin holes by 2 mm. For example, a tapered watch strap can be 20 mm at the watch lugs and 18 mm at the buckle. The length of the strap is defined by the individual lengths of the short (buckle) and long (holes) sides, as follows: S : 65 mm / 110 mm M : 70 mm / 120 mm L: 80 mm / 130 mm. Choose the size of the strap and your preferred stitching thread color in the variations section of the order. While not shown in the picture, \"white\" and \"black\" thread options are available. If you need a custom width / length please choose the \"Custom\" option and provide the sizing details in the order notes.",
